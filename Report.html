This Recipes Program is working with the spoonacular API to help you find a recipe
with the ingredients you have available.

The main_window() function opens a window in which the user can input the ingredients
they have available.

By clicking 'ok' in the widow, the program works with the API, to find the top 10 recipes
which include the input ingredients. The 10 recipes shown are the ones which either only include the input inredients,
or have the least amount of additional ingredients required.
This is in order to avoid not showing any recipes if the user only inputs few ingredients.

The layout_window () defines the layout and style of the window.

The get_recipes() function communicates with the spoonacular API to find recipes with the input ingredients.
When you click 'Show Recipe' the chosen recipe link will open in your browser.
