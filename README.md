# Recipes Project
Recipes_Project

Description:
This software will help you try new recipes without having to go grocery shopping. 
List the ingredients that you'd like to use, and this program will show you all recipes
from a database of 350.000 recipes that include those ingredients. If you list very few ingredients,
the recipes shown may include some things you did not input. But the top recipes shown, 
will be the ones with the least amount of additional ingredients needed. 

Outside of the course for which this program was made, please make your own API key through spoonacular 
in order to run the program. This can be changed under api_key.
